# Student Performance Prediction
This project explores the relationship between various factors (study hours, attendance, etc.) and students' final grades using **Multiple Linear Regression**.

## Key Features
- **Regularization Techniques:** Applied Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to prevent overfitting.
- **Feature Selection:** Used LassoCV to identify the most impactful predictors.
- **Optimization:** Used Cross-Validation to find optimal hyper-parameters.
